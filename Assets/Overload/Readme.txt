Hi there!

As soon as there are some scripts to work with loops here is a small usage guide:

  *	RandomSound - Create asset using "Create/Sound/Random Sound" menu. 
	Provide some audio clips and get random clip every time by calling "GetClip()".
	
  *	Sustained Sound - Component to play looped sound with random Start and End oneshots.
	Call Play(), Stop() or SetIsPlaying(bool) to control playback.

In the OverloadDemo scene you'll find all sounds cofigured. Start scene and hold the buttons.
You will also find all sounds configured in Prefabs folder.
