Hi there!

Raw samples are located in Sounds/[SurfaceName]/Clips.

* All the samples are already packed into "RandomSound" assets (find them in Sounds/[SurfaceName]).
* Use "PlayRandomSound.Play()" to play "RandomSound" assets.
* Or use "RandomSound.GetClip()" to get random audio clip from "RandomSound" asset.

You can try all the sounds in Demo/SiberianFootsteps_Demo scene
No additional coding needed
You can delete Demo folder completely if you want.

Demo scene controls:
WASD - Move
Right Mouse Button - Look
Shift - Run
